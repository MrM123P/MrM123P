ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrM123P<br> 
I'm an aspiring programmer, currently learning the absolute basics of front-end web development but I also want to learn c# because of unity, rust because someone recomended me it saying it's good to know it and c++ cuz i just want to learn it for some reason lmao, though if you have any suggestions on languages that that could increese my versatility, i'd be glad for some adivces (my discord is @mrm123p)<br>
My main inspiration for starting the journey to become at least somewhat decent programemr's been GD Colon<br>
I hope to see myslef making some cool projects or at least being something, especially since programming is something I find fun (at least for now ðŸ˜…)<br>
